# Art Of Alchemy II

On Friday, August 21st the fabric community was notified that Amelia Rose, known to us as SynthRose had tragically passed away. In the wake of that announcement, the community came together in unity and solidarity to remember SynthRose, her work, and her place in our community.

The goal of this mod is to allow SynthRose's memory to live on in her work, and to posthumously complete and maintain her contributions to the fabric modding community. It would feel wrong to simply continue publishing under the previous version number and name, for we personally feel it would disrespectful to her memory. So instead, Art of Alchemy II is designed to be a distinctly separate entity, as an expansion of the original project, dedicated to SynthRose.

There are no plans to change the fundamental core principles of the project, but to simply maintain, and expand upon the SynthRose's original vision for the project. The II in the name is simply to distinguish between the work originally done by SynthRose and the work done by the Fabric community.

### FAQs

**Can you port this mod to forge?**
We will not be porting this mod to forge, nor will we officially support any ports to the forge modding platform. We maintain and develop this mod in our limited free time. For us it makes more sense to work on adding more feature into the mod than maintaining two versions of it. That being said, this project is licensed under the MIT license meaning if you so desire, you can freely port the mod to forge, but you will not get our official support in any capacity. For more information on why we have this policy please read [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Vaerian/12b5e8afe1593bf07ea672ed208ac617).

**Can you update the mod to the latest version?**
In most cases the mod ought to be updated to the latest version, however, if it is not, be assured that we are working hard in order to update as soon as possible. Unfortunately, however, that often takes a little bit of time. Alternatively, if you'd like to contribute towards updating, feel free to make a [pull request](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy-II/pulls) and we'll be sure look over it.

**I have a cool idea for a feature. Can you add it?**
We make no guarantees about whether or not your idea will make it into the project, however, making a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy-II/issues) is the best way to get our attention. We'll make sure to read through your idea, evaluate whether or not we feel it fits within the scope of the project, and then if we like your idea, we'll add it into the project.

**I found a bug. Can you fix it?**
Submit a request on the [issues page](https://github.com/Cumulus-Mods/Art-of-Alchemy-II/issues) and We'll make sure to take a look at it and do as much as we can in order to fix the issue. It also helps if you provide a crash log, or some more details about what specific behavior is buggy.
